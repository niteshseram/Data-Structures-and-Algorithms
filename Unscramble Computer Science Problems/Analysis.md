# Analysis
## Task0
Time Complexity is **O(1)** since accessing first and last element of array takes O(1).
## Task 1
Since I am sequentially accessing both files, the time complexity is **O(n)**
## Task 2
The time complexity for this task is **O(n)** since we are accessing all the calls record
## Task 3
The time complexity for this task is **O(nlogn)** since I am using the sort method which has complexity
of O(nlogn).
## Task 4
The time complexity for this task is **O(nlogn)** since I am using the sort method which has complexity
of O(nlogn).
