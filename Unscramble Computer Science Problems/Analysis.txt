Step 3 of Project Unscramble
## Task0
Since accessing array takes O(1) complexity
find first record=> O(1)
find last record=> O(1)

##Task1
Since we are sequentially accessing both files, the complexity is
O(n)

##Task2
The complexity for this task is O(n)since we are accessing all the calls record

##Task3
The complexity for this task is O(nlogn) since I am using the sort method which has complexity of O(nlogn).

##Task4
The complexity for this task is O(nlong) since I am using the sort method which has complexity of O(nlogn).
