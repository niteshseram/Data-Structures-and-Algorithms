# Data Structures and Algorithms Udacity Nanodegree Projects
The project here are my course work project for Udacity Nanogeree program.
This repository contains 3 projects which I completed to get my Data Strcutures and Algorithms Nanodegree from Udacity
### Project 1- Unscramble Computer Science Problems
This project was under the course section of Data Strcutures which included topics like Arrays, Linked Lists, Queues, Recursion, Trees, Maps, and Hashing.

### Project 2- Problems vs. Algorithms
This project was under the course section of Basic Algorithms which included topics like Binary Search, Heaps, Tries, Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, and Heap sort), and Divide and Conquer Algorithms.

### Project 3- Route Planner
This project was under the final course section of Advanced Algorithms included topics lke Greedy Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, and Dynamic Programming

## Certificate of Completion
